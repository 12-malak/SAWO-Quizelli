## Inspiration

According to the Guinness World Record, Marilyn vos Savant, one of the persons with highest IQ broke the record and scored an unimaginable rank. This inspiring story sheds light on why an individual should never underestimate themselves and continue to achieve their goals. But there is a large scale of drawback the world is facing at present. After a detailed survey, it can be concluded that the aptitude test anxiety is real, which goes unnoticed by majority of the population. Hence, to overcome such anxiety, our team came up with an idea of developing an app. As aptitude tests are designed to understand and acknowledge the abilities of a learner, one should know the importance of being challenged by others, of having their potential recognized, and of celebrating achievements. In addition, it also helps to identify the abilities that are strongest as well as the weakest.

## What it does
The SAWO-Quizellio app has been built with a motive to enhance aptitude skills of people, while encouraging them to let go of their fears and proceed further in their learning and upskilling journey. 

## How we built it

At first, we worked on the ideation. Then we built the application using React and integrated the SAWO API. 

## Challenges we ran into

It took us a lot of time to take note of the data and verify its authenticity. But the hard work was all worthwhile. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our team has worked on the report, which involves research and survey based details. We proceeded further with the app development and its usability. With the tireless support of the team, our project turned into a success. 

## What we learned

Every member in our team worked collectively to research and analyze the significance of the solution. After discussing and planning, we thought of how this app is going to shape future of each individuals.

## What's next for SAWO-Quizellio

In future, SAWO-Quizellio has the potential to turn into a platform for e-learning, where people of different age group can browse for factual knowledge along with improving their aptitude, quantative knowledge and verbal skills. This app will provide people an ease of use and access to search, test their skills. Share useful resources among each other will help people connect and encourage them to bring the best out of themselves in a long run.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
